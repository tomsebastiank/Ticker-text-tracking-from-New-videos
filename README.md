# Ticker-text-tracking-from-New-videos
OpenCV project - Ticker text tracking from New videos

This code will take a news video as input and it will track the words inside the videos.
Tracked videos are later passed to an OCR module for writing the content in the ticker texts (Eg Flash news)
as txt file.
